# **Detailed Design Document: Security Component**

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1. Purpose**

This document details the design of the Security component, which resides in the Service Layer. Its primary purpose is to provide cryptographic services, secure communication mechanisms, and key management functionalities to other modules within the system. It aims to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity for sensitive operations like communication and firmware updates, abstracting the complexities of cryptographic primitives and secure storage.

### **1.2. Scope**

The scope of this document covers the Security module's architecture, functional behavior, interfaces, dependencies, and resource considerations. It details how Security provides services to ComM (for secure communication), OTA (for firmware verification), and Application/storage (for secure data storage).

## **2. Functional Description**

The Security component provides the following core functionalities:

1. **Security Initialization**: Initialize cryptographic hardware accelerators (if available) and secure storage.  
2. **Data Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt data blocks using symmetric (e.g., AES) or asymmetric (e.g., RSA) algorithms.  
3. **Hashing/Checksumming**: Generate cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256) or secure checksums for data integrity verification.  
4. **Digital Signature Verification**: Verify digital signatures of firmware images or data packets to ensure authenticity and integrity.  
5. **Key Management**: Securely store, retrieve, and manage cryptographic keys (e.g., private keys for signing, symmetric keys for encryption). This might involve hardware-backed secure storage.  
6. **Random Number Generation**: Provide a source of cryptographically secure random numbers.  
7. **Secure Communication Channel Setup**: Assist ComM in setting up secure communication channels (e.g., TLS for Wi-Fi, BLE pairing/encryption).  
8. **Error Reporting**: Report any failures during security operations (e.g., cryptographic failure, key corruption, invalid signature) to the SystemMonitor via RTE_SystemMonitor_ReportFault().

## **3. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **3.1. Performance**

* **Cryptographic Speed**: Perform cryptographic operations efficiently, especially for high-throughput communication or large firmware updates.  
* **Randomness**: Ensure the quality and unpredictability of generated random numbers.

### **3.2. Memory**

* **Minimal Footprint**: The Security code and data shall have a minimal memory footprint.  
* **Secure Storage**: Keys and sensitive data must be stored in a tamper-resistant manner (e.g., dedicated secure element, encrypted Flash regions).

### **3.3. Reliability**

* **Robustness**: The module shall handle invalid inputs or cryptographic failures gracefully.  
* **Tamper Detection**: Ideally, detect and respond to attempts to tamper with keys or secure data.  
* **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant security standards and best practices for embedded systems.

## **4. Architectural Context**

As per the SAD (Section 3.1.2, Service Layer), Security resides in the Service Layer. It provides foundational security services to other Service layer modules (ComM, OTA) and potentially Application layer modules (Application/storage). It leverages MCU-specific cryptographic hardware (if available) or software libraries.

### **5.3. Internal Design**

The Security module will leverage MCU-specific cryptographic hardware accelerators (if available) via MCAL or vendor-provided low-level security drivers. Otherwise, it will use well-vetted software cryptographic libraries. Key management will involve secure storage mechanisms.

1. **Initialization (SECURITY_Init)**:  
   * Initialize any underlying cryptographic hardware (e.g., MCAL_CRYPTO_Init()).  
   * Load any static/pre-provisioned keys (e.g., firmware update public key) from secure storage (e.g., MCAL_FLASH_Read from a secure partition, or a dedicated secure element driver).  
   * Perform self-tests of cryptographic modules.  
   * If any initialization or key loading fails, report SECURITY_ERROR_INIT_FAILED to SystemMonitor.  
   * Return SECURITY_OK.  
2. **Encryption/Decryption (SECURITY_Encrypt, SECURITY_Decrypt)**:  
   * Validate algo, key_id, input/output buffers.  
   * Retrieve the appropriate key from internal key storage based on key_id.  
   * Call the underlying cryptographic primitive (e.g., MCAL_AES_Encrypt(), software_aes_encrypt()).  
   * Handle padding, IV generation/usage as required by the algorithm.  
   * Report SECURITY_ERROR_ENCRYPT_FAILED/DECRYPT_FAILED or SECURITY_ERROR_KEY_NOT_FOUND if operations fail.  
3. **Hashing (SECURITY_GenerateHash)**:  
   * Validate algo, data, data_len, hash_buffer.  
   * Call the underlying hashing primitive (e.g., MCAL_SHA256_Hash(), software_sha256_hash()).  
   * Report SECURITY_ERROR_HASH_FAILED if operation fails.  
4. **Signature Verification (SECURITY_VerifySignature)**:  
   * Validate algo, public_key_id, data, signature.  
   * Retrieve the public key.  
   * Call the underlying signature verification primitive (e.g., MCAL_RSA_VerifySignature(), software_rsa_verify_signature()). This typically involves hashing the data first, then verifying the signature against the hash.  
   * Report SECURITY_ERROR_SIGNATURE_INVALID or SECURITY_ERROR_KEY_NOT_FOUND if verification fails.  
5. **Random Number Generation (SECURITY_GenerateRandom)**:  
   * Validate buffer, len.  
   * Call the underlying True Random Number Generator (TRNG) or Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) (e.g., MCAL_TRNG_Generate()).  
   * Report SECURITY_ERROR_INIT_FAILED (if TRNG not available/initialized) or other errors.

        MCAL_Crypto--xSecurity: Return MCAL_ERROR  
        Security->>SystemMonitor: RTE_SystemMonitor_ReportFault(SECURITY_SIGNATURE_INVALID, CRITICAL, ...)  
        Security--xRTE: Return SECURITY_ERROR_SIGNATURE_INVALID

        Security-->>RTE: Return SECURITY_OK  
        RTE-->>OTA: Return APP_OK  
    end
```

### **5.4. Dependencies**

* **MCAL Cryptographic Drivers**: (e.g., Mcal/crypto/inc/mcal_crypto.h) for hardware accelerators.  
* **Software Cryptographic Libraries**: If hardware acceleration is not available or insufficient (e.g., mbedTLS, tinycrypt).  
* **Application/logger/inc/logger.h**: For internal logging.  
* **Rte/inc/Rte.h**: For calling RTE_SystemMonitor_ReportFault().  
* **Application/common/inc/app_common.h**: For APP_Status_t.  
* **Service/security/cfg/security_cfg.h**: For configuration.

### **5.5. Error Handling**

* **Input Validation**: All public API functions will validate input parameters.  
* **Underlying Driver/Library Error Propagation**: Errors returned by MCAL cryptographic drivers or software libraries will be caught by Security.  
* **Fault Reporting**: Upon detection of an error (e.g., cryptographic operation failure, invalid signature, key not found), Security will report a specific fault ID (e.g., SECURITY_ERROR_INIT_FAILED, SECURITY_ERROR_ENCRYPT_FAILED, SECURITY_ERROR_SIGNATURE_INVALID, SECURITY_ERROR_KEY_NOT_FOUND) to SystemMonitor via the RTE service.  
* **Return Status**: All public API functions will return SECURITY_Status_t indicating success or specific error.

### **5.6. Configuration**

The Service/security/cfg/security_cfg.h file will contain:

* Enable/disable flags for specific cryptographic algorithms.  
* Configuration for key storage (e.g., use hardware secure element, specific Flash partition).  
* Public key data for firmware verification (if stored in code).  
* Any other security-related parameters.
```c
// Example: Service/security/cfg/security_cfg.h  
#define SECURITY_ENABLE_AES         1  
#define SECURITY_ENABLE_SHA256      1  
#define SECURITY_ENABLE_RSA         1

// Key storage configuration  
#define SECURITY_KEY_STORAGE_HW_SECURE_ELEMENT 0 // 1 if using HW secure element, 0 for Flash  
#define SECURITY_FW_PUB_KEY_FLASH_ADDR         0x00008000 // Example Flash address for public key
```

### **5.7. Resource Usage**

* **Flash**: Moderate to high, depending on the number of algorithms implemented and the size of stored keys/certificates.  
* **RAM**: Moderate, for cryptographic contexts, buffers, and key material during operations.  
* **CPU**: Can be high for complex cryptographic operations (e.g., RSA signature verification) if not hardware accelerated. Minimal for hashing or symmetric encryption with hardware support.

## **6. Test Considerations**

### **6.1. Unit Testing**

* **Mock Underlying Crypto/Key Storage**: Unit tests for Security will mock underlying MCAL cryptographic drivers, secure element interfaces, or Flash read/write functions to isolate Security's logic.  
* **Test Cases**:  
  * SECURITY_Init: Verify initialization of underlying crypto, key loading, and self-tests. Test error propagation.  
  * SECURITY_Encrypt/Decrypt: Test with known plaintext/ciphertext pairs for enabled algorithms. Test valid/invalid keys, buffers, lengths.  
  * SECURITY_GenerateHash: Test with known data and expected hash values.  
  * SECURITY_VerifySignature: Test with valid and invalid signatures, data, and public keys.  
  * SECURITY_GenerateRandom: Test for randomness (statistical tests, not strictly unit testable but can check for non-zero output).  
  * Error reporting: Verify that RTE_SystemMonitor_ReportFault() is called with the correct fault ID on various error conditions.

### **6.2. Integration Testing**

* **Security-MCAL/Hardware Integration**: Verify that Security correctly interfaces with actual cryptographic hardware accelerators (if present).  
* **OTA Security Integration**: Perform OTA updates with signed/unsigned/corrupted firmware images and verify that Security correctly accepts/rejects them.  
* **Secure Communication Integration**: Integrate with ComM to establish secure communication channels (e.g., TLS, BLE encrypted link) and verify data confidentiality and integrity.  
* **Key Management**: Test the secure provisioning and retrieval of keys. If using a secure element, verify its functionality.  
* **Fault Injection**: Simulate cryptographic hardware failures or key corruption to verify Security's error handling and reporting.

### **6.3. System Testing**

* **End-to-End Security**: Verify that all security features (secure boot, firmware updates, communication) function correctly in the integrated system.  
* **Penetration Testing**: Conduct security audits and penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities.  
* **Long-Term Stability**: Run the system for extended periods under various operational conditions to ensure security features remain robust.  
* **Resource Impact**: Monitor CPU and RAM usage during cryptographic operations to ensure they don't negatively impact real-time performance.
