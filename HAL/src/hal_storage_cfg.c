/**
 * @file hal_storage_cfg.c
 * @brief Configuration implementation for the HAL_Storage module.
 *
 * This file can be used to define global variables or perform any
 * initialization specific to the HAL_Storage configuration.
 *
 * For simple macro-based configurations, this file might be minimal
 * or not strictly necessary if all configurations are handled via
 * preprocessor directives in hal_storage_cfg.h.

#include "hal_storage_cfg.h"

// No specific implementation needed here if all configurations are
// handled via #define in hal_storage_cfg.h.
// However, if you had complex configuration structures or runtime
// initialization of configuration, it would go here.

// Example: If you had a struct for configuration that needed initialization:
/*
typedef struct {
    uint32_t flash_base_address;
    uint32_t eeprom_base_address;
} HAL_Storage_Config_t;

HAL_Storage_Config_t hal_storage_config = {
    .flash_base_address = 0x10000, // Example
    .eeprom_base_address = 0x0,    // Example
};
