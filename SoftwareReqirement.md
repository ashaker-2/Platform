# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) â€” Environmental Monitoring & Control System

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the software-level requirements for the Environmental Monitoring & Control System. It complements the System Requirements Specification (SyRS) and covers the architecture, communication protocols, memory layout, bootloader logic, and OTA update mechanisms.

## 2. Target Platform
- **Hardware Type**: ESP32 (abstracted via HAL, can be replaced)
- **Operating System**: FreeRTOS (abstracted, replaceable)
- **Architecture Style**: Layered software design (similar to AUTOSAR separation of concerns)

## 3. Software Architecture

### 3.1 Layered Architecture
The system employs a strict layered architecture to achieve separation of concerns and reduce interdependencies.

### 3.1.2 Layer Descriptions
- **Application Layer**: Implements the core business logic and high-level functionalities of the Environmental Monitoring & Control System.
- **Service Layer**: Provides high-level communication management (ComM), operating system services (os), Over-the-Air (OTA) updates (ota), and security services (security), abstracting complexities from the application layer.
- **HAL Layer**: Provides hardware-independent interfaces for peripherals and includes higher-level drivers for communication protocols (Modbus, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).
- **MCAL Layer**: Device-specific drivers for GPIO, UART, PWM, ADC, etc.
