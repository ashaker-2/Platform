# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) â€” Environmental Monitoring & Control System

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the software-level requirements for the Environmental Monitoring & Control System. It complements the System Requirements Specification (SyRS) and covers the architecture, communication protocols, memory layout, bootloader logic, and OTA update mechanisms.

## 2. Target Platform
- **Hardware Type:** ESP32 (abstracted via HAL, can be replaced)
- **Operating System:** FreeRTOS (abstracted, replaceable)
- **Architecture Style:** Layered software design (similar to AUTOSAR separation of concerns)

## 3. Software Architecture
