# **Software Requirements Specification (SRS) â€” Environmental Monitoring & Control System**

## **1. Introduction**

This document defines the software-level requirements for the Environmental Monitoring & Control System. It complements the System Requirements Specification (SyRS) and covers the architecture, communication protocols, memory layout, bootloader logic, and OTA update mechanisms.

## **2. Target Platform**

* **Hardware Type:** ESP32 (abstracted via HAL, can be replaced)  
* **Operating System:** FreeRTOS (abstracted, replaceable)  
* **Architecture Style:** Layered software design (similar to AUTOSAR separation of concerns)

## **3. Software Architecture**

### **3.1 Layered Architecture**

The system employs a strict layered architecture to achieve separation of concerns and reduce interdependencies.
